build/
# Ensure the Gradle wrapper JAR is NOT ignored (if you commit it)
!gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar
# The following lines un-ignore 'build' directories within src, which is very unusual.
# Typically, you'd want to ignore the entire top-level 'build' directory.
# Review if these are truly needed; they might indicate an unconventional setup
# or a misunderstanding of how .gitignore works with build outputs.
# !**/src/main/**/build/
# !**/src/test/**/build/

# Maven Build System
target/
# Ensure the Maven wrapper JAR is NOT ignored (if you commit it)
!.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar
# The following lines un-ignore 'target' directories within src, also very unusual.
# Similar to the 'build/' comments above, review if these are truly needed.

# !**/src/test/**/target/
